#### Introduction

To understand and unlock the full potential of India's electric vehicle market, we're embarking on a segmentation project. Through a combination of market research, customer surveys, and data analysis, we'll be dissecting the EV consumer base. Our aim is to uncover distinct customer segments, each with their own unique needs and preferences. By gaining these insights, we can tailor targeted strategies to effectively reach each segment and accelerate the overall growth of India's EV market.
